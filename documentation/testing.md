# Testing

## Overview

We are using Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, for testing our JavaScript code. To run the tests, run `npm test` from the root directory. In addition, `npm test` has been included in one of our Github workflows; the tests run every time a pull request is opened against the main branch. The test files can be found in the `lib/__tests__` directory.

## Standards

Here is a list of standards that we try to adhere to when creating tests:

1. Tests should be deterministic. Running a test multiple times should produce the same result.
2. Use the Jest function `describe` to group the tests for a method together.
3. Test names should state what the purpose of the related test is for.
4. Tests should not interfere with the actual code or other tests. Mocking variables and functions is one way of achieving this.
5. Use the test setup and teardown methods that Jest has to reduce the amount of repeated code between tests.

## Manual Testing

### Creating an account

1. Remix the project on Glitch.
2. Set the DOMAIN environment variable in `.env` file. It should be `{glitch-project-name}.glitch.me`.
3. Enter your domain in the browser. It should redirect you to `/account/create`, where you can create an account.
4. Add a username and password of your choice. The domain should be the same as the one in the `.env` file.
5. Create the account; you should be logged in and redirected to `/private` to see your account.

### Logging into an account

1. When you go to `/private`, if you are not logged in, you should be redirected to `/account/login`.
2. Enter your username and password.
3. If the credentials are correct, you should be redirected to `/private` to see your account. If the credentials are incorrect, you should be prompted to enter the correct credentials.

### Logging out of an account

1. Go to `/account/logout`.
2. You should be logged out and should be prompted to login again.

### Home page

1. After creating an account/logging in, you should be redirected to the home page. On the left hand side, there should be different sections: `Latest`, `Notifications`, `Messages`, `Compose`, `My Posts`, `Prefs`, and `Bugs & Issues`. The default section that is selected should be `Latest`.
